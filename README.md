# I have (Unofficially) taken over this project because I wish to use this for my game development.
### This fork is for me to make changes and port to Blender 3.2.1
This fork is not meant to take over the original, but the original repo has been abandoned for almost 2 years.

#### If you find any issues, then please report them and i'll try to fix it.
I hate Python though, but I will still try!
#### Fixed version:
